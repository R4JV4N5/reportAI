Given a user's question about this data, write a valid  SQLite3 query that accurately extracts or calculates the requested information from these tables and adheres to SQL best practices for sqlite3, optimizing for readability and performance where applicable.

Here are some tips for writing SQLite 3 queries:
Do not use complex querying approaches.

Question:
--------
{user_question}
--------
Reminder: 
Reminder: Generate a SQL to answer to the question:
* respond as a valid JSON Document
* [Best] If the question can be answered with the available tables: {{"sql": <sql here>}} 
* If the question cannot be answered with the available tables: {{"error": <explanation here>}}
* Ensure that the entire output is returned on only one single line
* Keep your query as simple and straightforward as possible; do not use subqueries
